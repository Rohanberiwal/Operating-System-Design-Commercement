FIFO, 
which stands for First-In-First-Out, 
is one of the simplest and most straightforward page
replacement algorithms used in operating systems for memory management.

Page Frame Queue:

Maintain a queue of page frames in memory.
Page Request:

When a page is referenced, check if it is already in a page frame.
If the page is in a frame, there is a page hit, and no further action is needed.
If the page is not in a frame (a page fault), proceed to the next step.
Page Replacement:

If a page fault occurs and there is space available in the memory frames, bring the requested page into an available frame.
If there is no space (all frames are occupied), replace the page in the frame that has been in memory the longest.
Update Queue:

After a page is replaced, update the page frame queue by moving the replaced page to 
the end of the queue (indicating it is the most recently brought in).
Repeat:

Repeat this process for subsequent page references.
