LRU (Least Recently Used):

LRU is a caching algorithm that keeps track of the order in which elements are accessed. 
The idea is to evict the least recently used element when the cache is full.
This is based on the assumption that recently used elements are more likely to be used again soon.
Clock Algorithm:

The Clock algorithm is a page replacement algorithm used in operating systems. 
It uses a circular list (or array) of page frames, and each page frame has an associated "use" bit. 
The algorithm scans through the pages in a circular manner, and when a page needs to be replaced,
 it looks for the first page with the "use" bit not set (0). If all bits are set, it makes a second pass, setting the bits to 0 until it finds a page to replacement .
Use a Circular List:

Like the Clock algorithm, maintain a circular list of page frames.
Maintain Recency Information:

Track the recency of access for each page, similar to LRU. This could involve maintaining a timestamp or a counter for each page.

Page Replacement:

When a page needs to be replaced, use a combination of Clock's circular scanning and LRU's recency information to make the decision.
Scan through the circular list, checking both the "use" bit (Clock) and the recency information.
Identify a candidate page that is both not recently used (use bit not set) and not recently accessed (according to LRU criteria).
Update Information:

Update the recency information for the accessed page.
