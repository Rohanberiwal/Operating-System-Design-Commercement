Belady's Algorithm," is an idealized page replacement 
algorithm used for benchmarking other algorithms. It makes the best 
possible decisions by replacing the page that will not be used for the longest period in the future. 
While OPT is impractical for actual implementation due to its requirement for future knowledge, 
it provides a theoretical upper bound for the performance of page replacement algorithms.

Here's how the Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm works:

Future Page Reference Prediction:

OPT assumes perfect knowledge of future page references.

Page Request:

When a page fault occurs, and a new page needs to be brought into a frame, 
the algorithm looks into the future and selects the page that will not be used for the longest period.
Page Replacement:

If all frames are occupied, the algorithm selects the page in memory that has 
the longest time until it is next referenced and replaces it with the new page.
Optimality:

The OPT algorithm always selects the optimal page replacement, minimizing the number of future page faults.
