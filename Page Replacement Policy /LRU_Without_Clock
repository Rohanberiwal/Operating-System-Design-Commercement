The Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement algorithm is a commonly used
algorithm that aims to keep track of the order in which pages are accessed and 
selects the page for replacement that hasn't been used for the longest period of time. 
There are different implementations of LRU, but one straightforward approach is to use a counter or
a timestamp to record the time of the last access for each page.

Here's a simplified explanation of the LRU page replacement algorithm:

Initialization:

Assign a counter or timestamp to each page when it is brought into memory.
Page Access:

When a page is referenced, update its counter or timestamp to the current time.
Page Replacement:

When a page fault occurs and a new page needs to be brought into a frame, select the 
page with the oldest counter or the earliest timestamp for replacement.
Repeat:

Continue this process for subsequent page references.
The goal is to keep track of the recency of page accesses and prioritize retaining
pages that have been used more recently. This helps to minimize the number of page faults.
