In multithreading, the execution of threads can occur in either parallel or sequential fashion,
depending on the system and the nature of the tasks being performed. Let's explore both concepts:

Parallel Execution:

In a parallel execution model, multiple threads run simultaneously on multiple processors or cores. 
Each thread is assigned to a separate core, and they execute independently of each other. 
This model allows for true parallelism, where multiple tasks are performed simultaneously, potentially
leading to improved performance and efficiency.

Sequential Execution:

In a sequential execution model, threads are scheduled and executed one after the other, 
typically sharing the same processor or core. Only one thread runs at any given time, and 
the execution of threads appears to be sequential. The operating system's thread scheduler
determines the order in which threads are allowed to execute, and the appearance of concurrency is achieved through time-slicing.

Hybrid Approaches:
Many-to-One (M:1) Model:

In some threading models, multiple user-level threads are mapped to a single kernel-level thread.
In this case, only one thread can execute at a time in the kernel space, providing an appearance of 
sequential execution. However, user-level threads may still run in parallel on multiple processors or cores if available.

Many-to-Many (M:N) Model:

This model allows multiple user-level threads to be mapped to a smaller or equal number of kernel-level threads. 
It provides a balance between parallelism and efficient use of system resources.
Considerations:
The choice between parallel and sequential execution depends on the hardware architecture, 
operating system, and the nature of the tasks being performed.
Parallel execution is more likely to provide performance benefits in scenarios where tasks can be 
effectively divided and executed concurrently.
Sequential execution might be sufficient or preferred in scenarios where tasks are interdependent 
or the overhead of parallelization is not justified.
