Virtual Memory 

Virtual memory is a memory management technique used in the modern computer system that provide an abstraction ont the computer's Physical memory RAM and extends beyond the avaible memory beyond the physical memeory RAM 
Virtual memeory provides :
1)Address space Abstraction 
> Virtual memory provides processes with a uniform, contiguous address space that appears much larger than the physical RAM.
> Each process operates in its own isolated virtual address space, simplifying memory management and ensuring that processes don't interfere with each other.
> Virtual memory ensures that one process cannot directly access the memory of another process.
> This memory protection mechanism enhances security and stability in multi-process or multi-user environments

Use of the physical Memory 
> Virtual memory allows the operating system to load only the necessary parts of a program or data into physical RAM, leaving the rest on disk.
> This results in efficient utilization of physical memory and enables the running of larger applications than would be possible with physical RAM alone.


Paging Memory 
> Virtual memory typically uses a technique called memory paging, where memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called pages. When a program accesses a memory location, the operating system retrieves the corresponding page from disk and loads it into physical memory.

> If there isn't enough free physical memory, less frequently used pages can be swapped out to disk.

Problem of overheads and the fault tolenrance in the virtual Memory
> If a program tries to access a portion of memory not currently in physical RAM (a page fault), the operating system can retrieve the required data from secondary storage (e.g., a hard drive or SSD). This fault tolerance prevents crashes due to running out of memory.


Physical and Virual addresses of a process

1) Physical addresess
A physical address, also known as a real address, is the actual location of a memory cell in physical memory hardware (RAM). It is a binary number that specifies the exact location of data in physical memory.
Physical addresses are used to identify the physical location of data in RAM chips. Every byte of data in RAM has a unique physical address.
The CPU uses physical addresses to read from or write to specific locations in RAM.

2)Virtual Address:

A virtual address is an address used by a process or program to access memory. It is an abstract address that may not directly correspond to a physical location in memory.
Virtual addresses are used to provide each process with its own isolated memory space, even if the physical RAM is limited.
The operating system manages the mapping of virtual addresses to physical addresses, allowing multiple processes to run concurrently without interfering with each other.
