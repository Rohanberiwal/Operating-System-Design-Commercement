 "Minimum Granularity for Scheduling Latency" in the context of real-time 
systems refers to the smallest unit of time within which a scheduling decision can be made.
Scheduling latency is the time it takes for a system to respond to an external event or interrupt by making a scheduling decision and dispatching a task.

Here are key points related to Constraint 2 - Minimum Granularity for Scheduling Latency:

1. Definition:
The minimum granularity for scheduling latency represents the smallest time interval that the real-time operating system can use for making scheduling decisions.
2. Impact on Real-Time Systems:
In real-time systems, meeting deadlines is crucial. A low minimum granularity allows the system to respond quickly
to events and reduces the time between an event occurrence and the execution of the corresponding task.
3. Trade-offs:
Achieving a very low granularity may lead to increased overhead, as the scheduler needs to make frequent decisions. 
This can impact overall system performance, especially in terms of context-switching overhead.
4. Hardware and Software Considerations:
The minimum granularity is influenced by both hardware and software factors. Hardware capabilities, such as clock precision,
play a role, as do the design choices made in the real-time operating system.
5. Determining the Value:
The value for the minimum granularity is often determined based on the specific requirements of the real-time application.
Some applications may require very fine-grained scheduling to meet stringent deadlines, while others can tolerate coarser granularities.
6. Adaptability:
Real-time systems may need to adapt their scheduling granularity based on the dynamic requirements of the tasks and the nature of the workload.
7. Examples:
For example, if a real-time system has a minimum granularity of 1 millisecond, it means that the system can make scheduling 
decisions and dispatch tasks with a resolution of 1 millisecond.
8. RTOS Configuration:
Real-time operating systems often provide configuration options for setting the scheduling granularity. System designers need 
to carefully choose this value based on the specific needs of the application.
9. Compliance with Standards:
Depending on the industry and application domain, there may be standards or guidelines that specify the acceptable minimum granularity for scheduling latency.
