 Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism to facilitate communication
between processes and between user space and kernel space. The reason is that 
processes run in separate user spaces, and the kernel space is privileged and restricted.

Here are a few reasons why IPC mechanisms are necessary:

User Space Isolation:

Processes are isolated from each other in user space for security and stability reasons.
They cannot directly access each other's memory. Therefore, if processes need to communicate or share data, 
an IPC mechanism is required.
Accessing Kernel Services:

Processes need a way to access services provided by the operating system in the kernel space. 
This is typically done through system calls, which act as a form of IPC. For example, when a 
process wants to perform file I/O or allocate memory, it makes a system call to request the kernel's services.
Communication Between Processes:

Processes may need to communicate with each other, exchange data, or synchronize their activities. 
IPC mechanisms provide a standardized way for processes to communicate.
Common IPC mechanisms include:

Message Passing: Processes send and receive messages through a messaging system provided by the operating system. 
This can be implemented using various techniques, such as sockets, message queues, or pipes.

Shared Memory: Processes can establish a shared memory region, allowing them to read and write data
in a common memory space. Synchronization mechanisms like semaphores or mutexes are often used with 
shared memory to avoid race conditions.

Synchronization Primitives: Kernel space provides synchronization primitives like semaphores, mutexes, 
and condition variables that processes can use to coordinate their activities.

Signals: Processes can use signals to notify each other of events or request specific actions.
This is a simple form of IPC used for process-to-process communication.

In summary, even though the kernel space is shared, IPC mechanisms are essential for processes to
communicate, access kernel services, and coordinate their activities in a controlled and secure manner.
